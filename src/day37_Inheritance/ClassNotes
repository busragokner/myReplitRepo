 Inheritance: to build IS A relationship(parent and child , super and sub)

    child class:(sub class) : can inherite all the variables & methods (visible) from the parent class
    parent class:(super class):can not inherit anything from child class.contain all the common feature
    that are meant to be inherited

    less codes
    improves the reusability
    clean
    less memory usage
    easy to maintain


    easiest way to get reach --> extends (genisletme)


    this keyword = referst to the instances Current

    this. : call instance variable & instance method
    this() : call the constructor of current class

    super keyword : referst to the instances. parent class
    super. : calls instance variables & instance methods of super class
    super() : calls the constructor from the parent class

    Constructor calls in inheritance:
    1. Child class MUST call parent class' constructor
    2. Parent class' default constructor is always called implicitly in child class
    3. Parent class constructor with argument need to be called explicitly

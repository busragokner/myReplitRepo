Static:
-> Declared with static keyword
-> Belongs to the class, and can be called through the class
-> There is only one copy of the static shared for all objects of the class
-> All the Objects of the class shares the same copy
-> If changes are made to static variables, all other instances will see the effect
of the change

==> when the variable to be the common value we use the static. for example pi number is fixed.
 it is not changeable and then we need to use static.

Static is applicable for the following
->Variables
->Methods
->Blocks
->Class

STATIC METHODS
-> If we declare any methods as static, its known as static methods
-> Objects can also call static methods
-> Static methods only accep static members
-> A method that can be called using class name, without creating objects

==> Static methos does not accept instances

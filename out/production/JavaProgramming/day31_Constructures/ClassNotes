TYPES OF CONSTRUCTORS : NO-ARGUMENT
--> A constructor that has no parameter
--> Also known as default constructor
--> If we do not define constructor is a class, then compiler creates default constructor.

TYPES OF CONSTRUCTORS : PARAMETERIZED
--> A constructor that has parameters
--> If we want to initialize the fields (instance variable) of the class with our own values
then we pass parameters to the constructor

public class Employee{
   public Employee(int age){
}}
